This is my final year project.It was aimed at opinion summarization.Thousands of reviews were collected from two retail websites of various phones.Each phone's reviews were stored in a separate tables.For all this, we made a custom web crawler and review extractor.The cr_re* python does that work.Once the reviews were stored on a local database the summarization process starts.
