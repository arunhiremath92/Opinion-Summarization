Communicating with machines is a very critical aspect and is no more through a programming language but through native speaking. 
Machine Learning powers the ability of machines to understand and process each instruction. The sentimental analysis is one such 
domain that categorizes opinions expressed in a piece of text or a statement as positive, negative or neutral. Excited in 
exploring the sentimental analysis further, I decided to submit my final year project on “Opinion mining and Summarization for Online reviews”.
Here we presented a graphical representation of consumers’ opinion on some popular features of a product, for instance, battery 
strength or camera quality in a phone. It allowed the potential buyers to filter and choose the product specific to their need. 
The project paved an opportunity for me to explore methods of natural language processing (NLP) and web scraping.
